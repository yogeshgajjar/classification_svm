Multi-Class and Multi-Label Classification using Support Vector Machines

## Overview

Multi-Class and Multi-Label Classification Using Support Vector Machines on Anuran Cells Data Set. The dataset contains three labels and each label has multiple classes. 

## Outcomes

- Trained SVM for each labels using Gaussian Kernels and one versus all classifiers. Also, trained the model using L1-penalized SVMs. 
- Used 10 fold CV to determine the weight of SVM penalty and width of the Gaussian Kernel. 
- Used SMOTE to remedy class imbalance and trained the classifiers.
